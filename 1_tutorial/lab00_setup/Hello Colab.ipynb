    "# Introduction to Colab\n",
    "During this course we will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the programming exercises. This notebook serves as an introduction and is meant to run in Colab. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Its main advantage is that Colab offers the possibility to run your code on high-end GPU's which are well suited for Deep Learning models and can speed up your programs significantly. Also, many of the Python packages that we will be using are already installed in this environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to do offline development outside of Colab you need to install Python and Jupyter on your own laptop, as well as the relevant Python packages. The GPU on your laptop is often not good enough to speed up the computations done in the models, so we recommend to still use Colab for this. \n",

    "Jupyter notebooks consist of cells that either contain text (such as this one) or code. The following cell contains Python code that can be executed in the notebook:\n"
